## CHARACTER BACKGROUND

### House Maroth
**Dahn Rank:** 10th (formerly 7th)  
**House Sigil:** An axehound with a gemheart in its jaws  
**House Colors:** Azure (deep blue) and Bronze  
**House Motto:** "The Hunt Yields Fortune"

**House Business:**
- **Primary:** Gemheart brokerage - buying gemhearts from plateau runs, selling to foreign markets and Alethi soulcasters
- **Secondary:** Breeding prize axehounds (more prestige/hobby than profit)

### The Fall of House Maroth

Your mother died in childbirth, leaving you as your father's only son and heir. The grief broke him. Lord Arvan Maroth, once a shrewd broker and respected gentleman, descended into depression and began making increasingly reckless business decisions.

Over three years, he invested the house's fortune into a gemheart consortium that funded multiple plateau run expeditions. The ventures failed catastrophically - chasmfiends killed entire teams, bridges were destroyed, and the financial losses mounted. Your father, desperate to recoup losses, bet even more heavily on subsequent runs.

When the dust settled, House Maroth had dropped from 7th dahn to 10th. Creditors - many of them darkeyed merchants and craftsmen - were never fully repaid. Your father retreated further into drink and bitterness, leaving you to carry the weight of restoration alone.

You don't blame him for grieving your mother. But you resent that his weakness destroyed your future. You won't make his mistakes - you can't afford sentiment, trust, or idealism.

### Current Situation

You serve as a junior officer in Highprince Sadeas's army, assigned to oversee bridge crews and dangerous operations that higher-ranked lighteyes avoid. It's brutal, thankless work, but it's also opportunity - chances to distinguish yourself where others won't go.

You were recently assigned to Bridge Nine and placed under the command of Brightness Eliah Matal, a scholar and archaeologist. This mission could be your chance to earn a favorable report and begin climbing back toward respectability.

Your father remains in the Maroth estate, drinking away what little remains. You visit rarely. Every time you see him, you're reminded of what you're fighting to restore - and what you refuse to become.

---

## PERSONALITY

**Ambitious and Calculating:** Every action is weighed against "does this advance House Maroth?" You're always thinking three moves ahead.

**Pragmatic About Honor:** You respect the Alethi codes... when convenient. You'll bend them if necessary, break them if you must. Honor is a luxury your house can no longer afford.

**Charming but Manipulative:** You've learned to read people, to say what they want to hear. Social interactions are transactions - what can you gain?

**Resentful:** Of your father's failures, of the lighteyes who look down on you, of the system that kicked you down. This resentment fuels your ambition.

**Competent and Capable:** You're actually good at what you do - tactical, skilled with a blade, intelligent. You've earned your position through merit, not just birth.

**Secretly Lonely:** Ambition isolates you. You trust no one fully. You've built walls around yourself.

**Master of Justification:** "It's for the house" excuses a lot. You've become skilled at rationalizing your choices.

---

## PURPOSE, OBSTACLE, GOALS

### Purpose
Restore House Maroth to its former glory - preferably surpass it. Ensure no one can ever do to you what circumstances did to your father.

### Obstacle  
Your ambition makes you ruthless and isolated. You're so focused on restoring your house that you risk losing your humanity in the process. You also struggle to trust anyone or accept genuine help - seeing everything as transactional.

### Goals

**Short Term:**
1. Excel in this mission with Bridge Nine and earn Brightness Matal's favorable report
2. Keep bridge crew functional (they're YOUR resource to command)
3. Identify opportunities for advancement or profit
4. Build useful contacts and network
5. Appear honorable while being ruthlessly effective
6. Learn who has real power in Sadeas's hierarchy

**Long Term:**
1. Restore House Maroth to 7th dahn minimum (preferably higher)
2. Gain command of a battalion or similar position of real authority
3. Acquire wealth through any effective means
4. Marry strategically for political advantage
5. Become indispensable to a highprince
6. Ensure House Maroth never falls again
7. Perhaps become a Shardbearer (ultimate status symbol)

## CONNECTIONS

**Lord Arvan Maroth (Father):** Your father, broken by grief and failure. Currently drinks away his days in the Maroth estate. You resent him but also pity him. You visit rarely - seeing him is painful.

**Bridge Nine Members:** The darkeyed bridge crew under your supervision. You see them as tools and resources, though they're YOUR responsibility. You're not needlessly cruel, but you're not particularly kind either.

**Brightness Eliah Matal:** The scholar and archaeologist you've been assigned to assist. She represents an opportunity - impress her, and doors might open. You're professional and competent in her presence.

**Highprince Sadeas's Officer Corps:** Your fellow officers, most of higher dahn than you. Some look down on you, some ignore you, a few might be potential allies. You're careful and calculating with all of them.

**Creditors and Former Associates:** Darkeyed merchants and craftsmen your house never fully repaid. They remember. Some are bitter, some sympathetic. This complicates your relationship with darkeyes in general.

**The Axehounds:** Your house still keeps a few prize breeding pairs. They're one of the last remnants of better times. You have a genuine soft spot for them - perhaps the only purely good thing in your life.

---

## POTENTIAL RADIANT PATH (FUTURE)

**Not Yet Bonded** - No spren bond currently

**Potential Path: Windrunner (Most Dramatic)**  
An honorspren may begin following you, appearing when you make unexpectedly honorable choices. This creates tension - you don't WANT to protect the weak, you want to USE them for advancement. The spren sees potential you don't believe you have.

**The Conflict:** Can you fake the ideals to get power? (No.) Will you choose power and honor, or ambition and expedience? This journey would force you to confront who you're becoming.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Skybreaker:** If you pursue justice (revenge?) and law
- **Dustbringer:** If you embrace control and calculated destruction
- **No Radiant Path:** Tragic option - reject the bond, choose worldly power

---

## CHARACTER QUOTES

*"Honor is a luxury my house can no longer afford."*

*"My father was honorable. Look where it got him."*

*"I don't need to be good. I need to be effective."*

*"The bridge crew? They're soldiers. Soldiers die. At least under my command, their deaths will mean something."*

*"When House Maroth sits at 7th dahn again, THEN I can afford principles."*

---

## NOTES

**House Sigil Details:** The Maroth sigil shows a sleek axehound with a large gemheart clutched in its jaws, rendered in bronze on an azure field. The gemheart gleams with internal light. It represents both sides of the house business - the noble hunt (axehounds) and shrewd commerce (gemhearts).

**Combat Style:** You prefer defensive, calculated fighting. You enter Vigilant Stance early in combat, reducing the cost of defensive reactions. You fight smart, not flashy - looking for openings, protecting yourself, waiting for the right moment to strike. You're competent with a longsword and not afraid to get your hands dirty, but you're not reckless. Every risk is calculated.

**Relationship with Darkeyes:** Complex. You're not needlessly cruel like some lighteyes, and you've seen that darkeyes can be competent and valuable. But you also see them as tools and resources. You're polite and professional, but there's distance. Some darkeyes appreciate this (better than cruel officers), others find it condescending.

**The Axehound Connection:** Axehounds are perhaps the only thing you genuinely care about beyond ambition. Working with them reminds you of childhood, before your mother's death, when your father was strong and your house was secure. It's a vulnerability you don't show often.

**Appearance Notes:** You're well-groomed and maintain your equipment meticulously - appearance matters for a lighteyes trying to climb. You're probably in your early-to-mid twenties. Light-colored eyes (pale green or blue - marking low dahn status). You move with controlled confidence and speak carefully, always aware of who's listening.
